        <p>Cats and dogs are two of the most popular domestic pets. While they are both furry and have four legs, they have several notable differences. Cats are known for their independent nature, preferring to spend time alone and often exhibiting aloof behavior towards their owners. They are generally low-maintenance pets that require minimal attention and can be left alone for extended periods. On the other hand, dogs are social animals that thrive on human interaction and require regular exercise and attention. They are often referred to as man's best friend due to their loyal and affectionate nature. While cats are typically quieter and more relaxed, dogs are more energetic and playful. Ultimately, the choice between a cat or a dog comes down to personal preference and lifestyle.</p>
